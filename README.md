# BiblioCatalog

Goal : create an app/soft that would allow me to catalog my home library

Language : C++

Programming IDE : Visual Studio 2017

08/30/2020 : Functions.h and Books.h done. Little interface coming with .exe. Thanks to it, you can add books to your CSV file, erase your CSV file, and watch which book you got in your CSV file.

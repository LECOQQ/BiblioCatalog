# BiblioCatalog

Goal : create an app/soft that would allow me to catalog my home library

Language : C++

Programming IDE : Visual Studio 2017

What to do next ? c++-wise : Add an erase only option, add commentaries to make the code easier to read
Start making an android app with the bibliocatalog in.

09/09/2020 : I added missings const&, changed the interface to get smtg universal.

09/01/2020 : Books.h class changed to get the csv datas in a class. In doing so i'm able to act on those data. Added a sort and a search function. 

08/30/2020 : Functions.h and Books.h started. You can add books to your library, erase them, and list them.
